Usage: $(basename $0) <path to topic> [transformer]
	This script truncates file \$1 for each linebuffered output generated by \$2 called with stdin pass-through.
	If \$2 is not specified, $default_transformer is used as default. The topic, or 1st argument WILL BE TRUNCATED! BE CAREFUL!
	Example: echo "hello" | $(basename $0) "topicFile" cat -- This will truncate topicFile to content "hello"
